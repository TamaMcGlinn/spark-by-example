* The Copy Algorithm

The ~Copy~ procedure copies the content of an array into another
array. Its signature is the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  procedure Copy (A : T_Arr; B : in out T_Arr);
#+END_SRC

The usefulness of this procedure could be doubted in Ada, since the
simple command ~A := B~ achieves the same goal for arrays with same
length. The purpose of this document being to prove classic
algorithms defined in [[https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/acsl-by-example][ACSL by Example]] for the C language, we choose
to keep ~Copy~.

** Specification of Copy

~Copy~ specification is the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  procedure Copy
    (A :        T_Arr;
     B : in out T_Arr) with
     Pre  => A'Length = B'Length,
     Post => B = A;
#+END_SRC

The precondition expresses the fact that ~A~ and ~B~ should be of
the same size. This is not a limitation, as copying part of an
array can be achieved through slicing. The postcondition expresses
that ~A~ and ~B~ are equal element-wise.

** Implementation of Copy

A possible implementation for ~Copy~ is the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  procedure Copy
    (A :        T_Arr;
     B : in out T_Arr)
  is
  begin
     for J in A'Range loop
        declare
  	 K : Positive := B'First + (J - A'First);
        begin
  	 B (K) := A (J);

  	 pragma Loop_Invariant (A (A'First .. J) = B (B'First .. K));

        end;
     end loop;
  end Copy;
#+END_SRC

We have defined a local variable ~K~ to hold the result of
~B'First + J - A'First~, i.e. the corresponding index of ~B~, for
readability. The loop invariant specifies that for all indexes ~L~
lesser than ~J~, then ~A(L) = B(K)~, i.e. the first ~I-A'First~
indexes of ~A~ have been copied in ~B~.

With this specification and implementation, when using ~GNATprove~
everything is proved.
