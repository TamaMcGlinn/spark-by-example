* The Partial_Sum algorithm

The ~Partial_Sum~ algorithm computes the consecutive partial
sums of an array. Its signature reads:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  procedure Partial_Sum (A : T_Arr; B : in out T_Arr);
#+END_SRC

The result of the algorithm will be stored in ~B~, and for all ~K~
in ~(0 .. A'Length - 1)~, ~B (B'First + K) = A (A'First) + A
   (A'First + 1) + .. + A (A'First + K)~. This can also be expressed
with the previously defined [[Accumulate.org][Accumulate]] algorithm: for all ~K~ in ~0
   .. A'Length-1~ then ~B (B'First + K) = Accumulate (A (A'First
   .. A'First + K), 0)~.

** Specification of Partial_Sum

Partial sum can be specified as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  procedure Partial_Sum
    (A :        T_Arr;
     B : in out T_Arr) with
     Pre => A'Length = B'Length
     and then (for all J in A'Range => Acc_Def (A, A'First, J, 0).OK),
     Post =>
     (for all J in A'Range =>
        B (B'First + (J - A'First)) = Acc_Def (A, A'First, J, 0).Value);
#+END_SRC

The preconditions express that ~A~ and ~B~ must be of same length,
and that there should be no overflows during the computation of
the sum. The postcondition expresses the fact that the element
found at index ~J~ in ~B~ is equal to the sum of the ~J~ first
elements of ~A~.

** Implementation of Partial_Sum

Given its specification, ~Partial_Sum~ can be implemented as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC ada
  procedure Partial_Sum
    (A :        T_Arr;
     B : in out T_Arr)
  is
  begin
     if A'Length > 0 then
        B (B'First) := A (A'First);
  
        for J in 1 .. A'Length - 1 loop
  
  	 pragma Assert (Acc_Def (A, A'First, A'First + J, 0).OK);
  	 pragma Assert
  	   (Add_No_Overflow (A (A'First + J), B (B'First + (J - 1))));
  	 B (B'First + J) := B (B'First + (J - 1)) + A (A'First + J);
  
  	 pragma Loop_Invariant
  	   (for all K in 0 .. J =>
  	      B (B'First + K) = Acc_Def (A, A'First, A'First + K, 0).Value);
  
        end loop;
     end if;
  end Partial_Sum;
#+END_SRC

This implementation is quite similar to the one of [[Accumulate.org][Accumulate]], the
assertions ensures that there are no overflows and the loop
invariant verifies that the computed values are correct.

With this implementation and specification, everything is proved
by ~GNATprove~.
